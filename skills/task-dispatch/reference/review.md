# Review Format

Implementation review tracking in `review.yaml`. Mirrors validation.yaml structure.

```
./specs/active/<spec-name>/review.yaml

## Schema

```yaml
# Review: ${SPEC_NAME}
# Machine + human readable implementation review tracking
#
# This file tracks batch reviews, accumulated issues, gate results, and
# final review status. Intended for both programmatic access (task-dispatch,
# task-continue) and human review.

## Usage

### Writing review.yaml

**After each batch review (Phase C):**

1. Read existing review.yaml (or create if first batch)
2. Append new batch_reviews entry
3. Update accumulated gates
4. Add new issues to appropriate severity list
5. Update deferred_issues if medium issues noted
6. Write updated review.yaml
7. Include in batch commit

**After final review:**

1. Read review.yaml
2. Populate final_review section
3. Update readiness checklist
4. Write final review.yaml

### Reading review.yaml

**By task-continue:**
- Check last batch reviewed
- Load deferred issues
- Determine next batch

**By code-review (final mode):**
- Load all batch results
- Identify patterns across batches
- Complete final_review section

| Gate | What It Checks |
|------|----------------|
| correctness | Logic errors, edge cases, error handling, type safety |
| style | Naming conventions, formatting, readability, idioms |
| performance | Efficiency, data structures, unnecessary computation |
| security | Input validation, secrets exposure, injection risks |
| architecture | Design patterns, coupling, separation of concerns |
